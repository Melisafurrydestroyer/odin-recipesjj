<h2>What Goes Into Potato Salad</h2>
<p>The best potato salads are a balance of flavors and textures, where creamy, tangy, sweet, salty, tender, and crunchy meet in perfect harmony. Here are the ingredients for this top-rated potato salad recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potatoes:</strong>It's not potato salad without potatoes. This recipe calls for medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad, I'll cover that in the next section.</li>
<li><strong>Eggs:</strong><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-boil-an-egg/">Hard-boiled eggs</a> are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to.</li>
<li><strong>Celery:</strong> Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.</li>
<li><strong>Onion:</strong>You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion.</li>
<li><strong>Relish:</strong>Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet.</li>
<li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.</li>
<li><strong>Mustard:</strong> Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonings: </strong> This recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Potatoes Are Best for Potato Salad</h2>
<p>The kind of potatoes you use will affect the texture of your potato salad. The recipe does not specify what kind of potatoes to use, but here are some guidelines to help you choose the best potatoes for potato salad so you get the results you're looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waxy potatoes,</strong> like red potatoes and fingerling potatoes, have a smooth texture and will hold their shape even after boiling. And with their thin, delicate skins, they might not even need peeling. Use waxy potatoes if you like firm potatoes in your potato salad.</li>
<li><strong>Starchy potatoes, </strong> like Idahos or Russets, break down when they're boiled but their starchy texture soaks up dressing beautifully. Use starchy potatoes if you like softer creamier potatoes in your potato salad, but you'll have to peel them because of their thicker skins.</li>
<li><strong>All-purpose potatoes,</strong> like Yukon Golds, hit the sweet spot between waxy and starchy potatoes, and are reliable choices for potato salad.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Long to Boil Potatoes for Potato Salad</h2>
<p>This recipe for Old-Fashioned Potato Salad instructs you to boil unpeeled potatoes in salted water until they're tender but still firm. You'll drain them and let them cool a bit, then peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. (Boiling helps the potato skins slip off easily.) Depending on how large your potatoes are, boiling could take between 10 to 15 minutes or more. Start testing for doneness at about 10 minutes by piecing a potato with a sharp paring knife. If it slides in easily all the way to the center of the potato, the potato is cooked and ready to drain.</p>

<ul>
<li>5 medium potatoes</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
<li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
<li>½ cup sweet pickle relish</li>
